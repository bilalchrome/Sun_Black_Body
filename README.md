# Sun_Black_Body

This script is meant to plot actual surface temperatures of the solar system planets as well as calculated temperatures against distance from sun.

Calculated temperatures adopt a model which assumes the sun as a black body, and ignores any planet atmosphere present, for easier temperature calculation.

I would cite the paper I used for the mathematical model, but I lost it :/
